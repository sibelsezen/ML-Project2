Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine
each applicant&#39;s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have historical
data from previous applicants that you can use as a training, where the first and second columns
are the scores for first and second exam, respectively and the third column shows the admission
result:
1=Admitted, 0=not-admitted.
